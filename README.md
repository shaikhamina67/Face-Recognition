# Face-Recognition

The scope of the face recognition attendance system encompasses the development of a robust software solution capable of accurately identifying individuals using facial recognition algorithms. The primary objective is to streamline the attendance tracking process, reduce manual errors, and enhance security measures within organizations. By implementing this system, organizations aim to improve efficiency, save time, and ensure accurate attendance records. 

# Modules and their Description 
1. Face Detection Module: This module detects faces within the input images or video streams using computer vision techniques. It identifies the location and size of faces present in the frame. 
2. Feature Extraction Module: Once faces are detected, this module extracts distinctive facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. These features are then used to create a unique facial template for each individual. 
3. Face Recognition Module: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this module compares the extracted facial features with the pre-registered templates in the database to recognize individuals. It determines the similarity score and matches the detected face with the corresponding identity. 
4. Attendance Management Module: After successful recognition, this module records the attendance of recognized individuals in the database. It maintains comprehensive logs of attendance records, including timestamps and student information.
